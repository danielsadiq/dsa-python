Data structures are building blocks for any software programs.
Data Structure is a way of collecting and organising data in such a way that we can perform 
operations on these data in an effective way.
The choice of a good data structure makes it possible to perform a variety of critical operations effectively. 
An efficient data structure also uses minimum memory space and execution time to process the structure.
The nature of the data determines the data structure.

Big O notation
O(1) - constant time
O(n) - linear time
O(log n) - log time
O(n^2) - quadratic time
